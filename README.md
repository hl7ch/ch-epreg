# CH EPREG
The **e**lectronic **preg**nancy passport contains all the important medical information needed during pregnancy, at birth and for six weeks afterwards to ensure comprehensive care. This information is entered in the pregnancy passport by the treating healthcare providers, such as gynecologists, midwives and general practitioners, as well as institutions such as clinics, birthing centres, practices or midwife organizations. 

* Concept on which this implementation guide is based: 
   * [Konzept eSchwangerschaftspass (DE)](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/upload/documents/eSchwangerschaftspass_Konzept_de.pdf)
   * [Concept eDossiergrossesse (FR)](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/upload/documents/eDossiergrossesse_Concept_fr.pdf)

## Current Status
Please note that not all data elements from the concept have been mapped in this first version of the implementation guide. However, all elements and sections described in the guide (document structure / use cases etc.) have already been mapped, enabling an initial use of the pregnancy passport.

The current status can be viewed in this [mapping table](TODO). Data elements highlighted in green have already been mapped.
