The **e**lectronic **preg**nancy passport contains all the important medical information needed during pregnancy, at birth and for six weeks afterwards to ensure comprehensive care. This information is entered in the pregnancy passport by the treating healthcare providers, such as gynecologists, midwives and general practitioners, as well as institutions such as clinics, birthing centres, practices or midwife organizations.
