The concept for the exchange format of the electronic pregnancy passport ([de](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/upload/documents/eSchwangerschaftspass_Konzept_de.pdf), [fr](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/upload/documents/eDossiergrossesse_Concept_fr.pdf)) defines all data elements in both German and French. These data elements are listed in tabular form below. The information from the concept has been supplemented with the respective mapping to FHIR (resources, elements) and any notes on modeling considerations.   

_Note: The mapping can also be found for each profile under its 'Mappings' tab, e.g. [CH EPREG Composition](StructureDefinition-ch-epreg-composition-mappings.html)._
