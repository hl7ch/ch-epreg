### Introduction
The **pregnancy passport** contains all the important medical information needed during pregnancy, at birth and for six weeks afterwards to ensure comprehensive care. This information is entered in the pregnancy passport by the treating healthcare providers, such as gynecologists, midwives and general practitioners, as well as institutions such as clinics, birthing centres, practices or midwife organizations. 

The CH EPREG implementation guide describes the FHIR representation of the **e**lectronic **preg**nancy passport in Switzerland. It is dependent on [CH Core](http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-core/index.html) and [CH Term](http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-term/index.html), which describe the Swiss-specific context, particularly in relation to the Swiss Electronic Patient Record (EPR).   
This implementation guide is based on the concept for the exchange format of the electronic pregnancy passport ([de](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/upload/documents/eSchwangerschaftspass_Konzept_de.pdf), [fr](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/upload/documents/eDossiergrossesse_Concept_fr.pdf)).

Please note that not all data elements from the concept have been mapped in this first version of the implementation guide. However, all elements and sections described in the guide (document structure / use cases, etc.) have already been mapped, enabling an initial use of the pregnancy passport. You can find the current status under [Mapping Concept Data Elements](mapping-concept-dataelements.html).

### MustSupport
In the concept for the electronic pregnancy passport, the data elements are described in terms of cardinality and conformity, which are then applied in the CH EPREG profiles (as long as it conforms to FHIR and the CH Core requirements). This table shows how the different levels of conformity are reflected in the FHIR profiles:

{:class="table table-bordered"}
| Concept (conformity) | FHIR profile (minimum cardinality and flag) |
| --- | --- | 
| **M**andatory: This is a required field. It must contain a valid value. | 1.. |
| **R**equired: The field should always contain a valid value if possible. | 0.. MS (`mustSupport`=true)|
| **O**ptional: The field may contain a valid value. | 0.. |

For CH EPREG the meaning of [mustSupport](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#mustSupport) follows also the IHE use of **R2 (Required if known)** as defined in [ITI TF-2: Appendix Z](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ch-Z.html#z.10-profiling-conventions-for-constraints-on-fhir):    
_If the sending application has data for the element, it is required to populate the element with a non-empty value. If the value is not known, the element may be omitted. A receiving application may ignore the information conveyed by the element. A receiving application shall not raise an error solely due to the presence or absence of the element._
