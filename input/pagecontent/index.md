### Introduction
The **pregnancy passport** contains all the important medical information needed during pregnancy, at birth and for six weeks afterwards to ensure comprehensive care. This information is entered in the pregnancy passport by the treating healthcare providers, such as gynecologists, midwives and general practitioners, as well as institutions such as clinics, birthing centres, practices or midwife organizations. 

The CH EPREG implementation guide describes the FHIR representation of the **e**lectronic **preg**nancy passport in Switzerland. It is dependent on [CH Core](http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-core/index.html) and [CH Term](http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-term/index.html), which describe the Swiss-specific context, particularly in relation to the Swiss Electronic Patient Record (EPR).   
This implementation guide is based on the concept for the exchange format of the electronic pregnancy passport ([de](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/upload/documents/eSchwangerschaftspass_Konzept_de.pdf), [fr](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/upload/documents/eDossiergrossesse_Concept_fr.pdf)).
